# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, and number of bathrooms using various machine learning models. The project employs a neural network model in addition to traditional regression models.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd home_price_prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the data:**

   Place your dataset (`melb_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open the Jupyter notebook for model development and experimentation:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/Home-price-model.ipynb
    ```

5. **Train the model:**

   Execute `train_model.py` to train and evaluate the models.

    ```bash
    python scripts/train_model.py
    ```

6. **Run the application:**

   Use `app.py` to start the backend server for your application.

    ```bash
    python scripts/app.py
    ```

7. **Run the front-end:**

   Start the front-end application with `front_end.py`.

    ```bash
    python scripts/front_end.py
    ```

## Model Description

- **Neural Network Model**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Traditional Models**: Includes `LinearRegression`, `Lasso`, and `Ridge` from `sklearn`.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes `OneHotEncoder`, `StandardScaler`, `ColumnTransformer`, and `Pipeline` for feature engineering and scaling.

## Usage

1. **Data Analysis**: Use the Jupyter notebook to analyze the dataset and explore feature engineering.
2. **Model Training**: Run `train_model.py` to train the models and evaluate their performance.
3. **Application**: Deploy the backend and front-end scripts to integrate and visualize predictions.
